# hackthon2022
 This is our submission for the 2022 onehacks hackthon (By Ido and Joe)

## Inspiration
During this year, me and my friend had to choose and apply to university; but the research was very complicated and confusing, especially on costs and tuition; there always seemed to be more and more unforeseen costs and comparing universities was even harder because each university had their own site. This is why me and my friend decided to help new students calculate and compare first-year tuition between universities, we made a calculator to help those people calculate and compare tuition.
## What it does
This calculator calculates and compares universities' tuition and costs. One can select their desired university, program and optional parameters in order to calculate how much they will have to pay for their first year of studies.
## How we built it
We used Vue.js and Bootstrap 5 with HTML and javascript in order to create this project.
## Challenges we ran into
Since we both still had final projects for school to hand in by Sunday eve, we only had 3 hours to work on this project. Another challenge we faced is research, getting the numbers was extremely hard because the websites are not very intuitive and require careful reading.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the animations we managed to create since neither of us ever used CSS animations before this was a nice learning experience. We are also proud of the short time it took us to create this project.
## What we learned
We learnt about many universities across Canada and their tuitions, we learnt CSS animations and we learnt how to use Bootstrap and Vue.js to build sites faster.
## What's next for Tuition Calculator.
We plan to give this out to first-year students in order to help them select a university. Not for profit and free of charge of course :)
